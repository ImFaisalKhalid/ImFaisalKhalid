### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Faisal Khalid. I am currently a final year student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science and Economics. **I am passionate about software development, computer security, and networks.** I love nothing more than challenging myself by solving tough problems and deeply understanding the technological world around me.

My mission in life is to be part of something bigger than myself and to **serve the country by building, improving, and securing critical technological infrastructure.**
